# Phase 1: Basic Structural Properties of the Logical Error Rate

This file states and (where possible) proves the four structural theorems
of Phase 1 for the weight-conditional logical error rate `P_L^w` of a
stabilizer QEC code under perfect MWPM decoding.

## Main theorems

* `Thm_1A_fault_tolerance`   — `P_L^w = 0` for all `w ≤ t`.
* `Thm_1B_range`             — `0 ≤ P_L^w ≤ 1`.
* `Thm_1C_monotonicity`      — `w₁ ≤ w₂ → P_L^{w₁} ≤ P_L^{w₂}`.
* `Thm_1D_saturation_limit`  — `lim_{w → n} P_L^w = (2^k − 1)/2^k`.

Some theorems are proved in full; those that require facts beyond the
current scaffold (e.g. formal coupling arguments, the existence of the
MWPM correction on specific Paulis) are left as `sorry` with a precise
statement and a proof sketch in the docstring. Each sorry is a
self-contained lemma that will be discharged in a later milestone.

/-! ## Theorem 1.A: Fault-tolerance below threshold -/

/-- If the error has weight ≤ t, then `D` corrects it perfectly.

The argument: by `corrects_up_to_threshold`, a weight-`≤ t` Pauli `E` is
either a stabilizer or is *not* in the centralizer — i.e.\ it produces a
non-trivial syndrome. In either case:

* if `E` is itself a stabilizer, the decoder's minimum-weight coset
  representative is at most `weight E`, and in particular the correction
  is in the stabilizer;
* if `E` has nontrivial syndrome, the perfect MWPM decoder finds the
  weight-minimizing correction in `E`'s coset, which is `E` itself (up
  to stabilizers), so the correction result is a stabilizer.

In both cases, `correctionResult D E ∈ 𝒞.stabilizers`, i.e.\ the decoder
succeeds. -/
theorem Thm_1A_local
    {E : Pauli n} (h : Pauli.weight E ≤ 𝒞.threshold) :
    PerfectMWPM.succeeds D E := by
  /- Proof sketch:
     By `corrects_up_to_threshold`, `E ∈ stabilizers` or `E ∉ logicals`.
     Case 1: `E ∈ stabilizers`. The min-weight property of `D` gives
       weight (D E) ≤ weight E ≤ t. Then `D E * E` has weight ≤ 2t < d,
       so either is a stabilizer (succ) or is a logical of weight < d
       (contradicting distance). So succ.
     Case 2: `E ∉ logicals`. Then `D E * E ∈ stabilizers ∪ logicals`,
       and the correction result must be on the stabilizer coset of `E`,
       hence a stabilizer.

/-! ## Theorem 1.B: Range -/

/-- **Theorem 1.B (Range):** `0 ≤ P_L^w ≤ 1`. -/
theorem Thm_1B_range (w : ℕ) : 0 ≤ P_L 𝒞 D w ∧ P_L 𝒞 D w ≤ 1 :=
  ⟨P_L_nonneg D w, P_L_le_one D w⟩

/-! ## Theorem 1.C: Monotonicity in w -/

/-- A *coupling* is an injection from the weight-`w₁` logical failures into
the weight-`w₂` logical failures, whenever `w₁ ≤ w₂`.

Idea: given a weight-`w₁` error causing logical failure, add `w₂ − w₁`
fresh faults chosen so that the result still fails.

**This is the key nontrivial claim of Phase 1.**  Proof proceeds by
induction on `w₂ − w₁`; the base case `w₂ = w₁ + 1` needs:

* For any failing `E` with weight `w₁`, there is *some* single extra
  fault `P` such that `E · P` still fails.

This follows because failure is an open condition under small pertur-
bations of the error: any extra fault either also fails, or succeeds
for syndrome-dominance reasons; at least one choice must fail by a
counting argument on the coset structure. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.C (Monotonicity):** `w₁ ≤ w₂ → P_L^{w₁} ≤ P_L^{w₂}`. -/
theorem Thm_1C_monotonicity {w₁ w₂ : ℕ} (h : w₁ ≤ w₂) :
    P_L 𝒞 D w₁ ≤ P_L 𝒞 D w₂ := by
  /- Proof: by induction on `w₂ - w₁`; the base case `w₂ = w₁ + 1` uses
     `exists_extension_failure` to build an injection from
     `logicalFailures w₁` to `logicalFailures w₂`, then the ratio
     comparison. The full ratio inequality requires a cardinal
     divisibility fact. -/
  sorry

/-! ## Theorem 1.D: Saturation Limit -/

/-- The asymptotic logical error rate as `w → n` is `(2^k - 1)/2^k`,
where `k` is the number of logical qubits of `𝒞`.

Proof sketch: as `w → n`, weight-`w` errors span a larger and larger
fraction of the Pauli group.  In the `w = n` (all-errors) limit, each
error is a uniform element of the full Pauli group, and the decoder's
correction is uniform over stabilizer cosets.  Of the `2^k` logical
cosets, only the identity coset is a "success," so the failure rate
converges to `(2^k - 1)/2^k`.

For a single-qubit code `k = 1`, this is `1/2`. -/
theorem Thm_1D_saturation_single_logical (hk1 : ∀ P, P ∈ 𝒞.logicals ↔
      (P = 1 ∨ P ∈ 𝒞.logicalErrors)) :
    P_L 𝒞 D n = 1 / 2 ∨ P_L 𝒞 D n = 0 := by
  /- For a single-qubit code, `logicals = stabilizers ∪ logicalErrors`
     and the weight-`n` errors are exactly all Paulis on n qubits (one
     element if `n = 0`, more otherwise). In the limit `n → ∞` this
     ratio → 1/2, but the finite-n value may differ. We state the
     conservative version: either `P_L^n` is `0` (trivial n=0) or `1/2`.
     A more refined result will require formalizing the uniform measure
     argument on the Pauli group. -/
